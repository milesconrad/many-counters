# many-counters
In my CS50 class, my teacher described JavaScript as a language that allows you to "edit HTML elements in real time" which almost immediately gave me the idea for this site.

There is no hidden meaning here. There is no pattern or dataset to observe. It's just a bunch of random counters.
